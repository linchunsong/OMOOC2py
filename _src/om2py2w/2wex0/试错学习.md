# 试错学习

想改下第九题，看下自己是否真的掌握了% 的用法，修改如下：

```
days = "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun"
months = "n\Jan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug"

san = 10
print "Here are the days: %r.", 
print "Here are the months: ", months

print """
There's something going here.
With the three double-quotes.
We'll be able to type as much as we like.
Even 4 lines if we want, or 5, or 6.
```

**效果**

```
➜  Practice  Python ex09.py
Here are the days: %r. 10 san # 为何san 所带的变量10到不了%r这个地方
Here are the months:  n\Jan
Feb
Mar
Apr
May
Jun
Jul
Aug

There's something going here.
With the three double-quotes.
We'll be able to type as much as we like.
Even 4 lines if we want, or 5, or 6.
```

再次改动，结果那行的提示一直如下：

```
➜  Practice  python prac.py
  File "prac.py", line 2
    print "Here are the days: %s.", % "x"
                                    ^
```

害我一直以为是百分号的问题。然后与第7题的代码进行对比

```
x = 100	
print "Its fleece was white as %s." % 'snow'
print "Here are the days: %s.". % x # "."在这里是错误的根源
```
.号删除：

```
➜  Practice  python prac01.py
Its fleece was white as snow.
Here are the days: 100.
```
